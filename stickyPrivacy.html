    <h3>    CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

    <p>    MedLache may change the privacy policy at any time, if we make a change we will notify
        you by revising the "Last UPDATE" up above.
        We encourage you to check our privacy policy frequently to stay informed with any
        changes that we make.</p>

        <h3>WHAT DO WE COLLECT</h3>

    <p>    We don't collect your information such as (name,email address,physical address,gps,
         or phone number) because we have not asked about any of them.

        If we ask you to provide a username its just gonna be stored in your device and once you
        uninstall the app or game its gone and we also don't even have a server database to store it in.</p>

      <p>  The apps and games do use third party services that may collect information used to
        identify you </p>
        <h3>Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the apps</h3>

<h3>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>
        <p>We will make an age limit for every game we publish so as far as we know we won't
        ask for any personal information from children.</p>

        <h3>GAMES TYPE</h3>
        <p>For now our games are just simple games that don't require any additional information
        from users when we change that we will let you know.
